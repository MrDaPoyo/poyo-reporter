# Linux ricing

Poyo: Welcome to the Poyo Reporter!
Poyo: What's your personal definition of ricing?

Overns: So, ricing is basically the art of customizing linux, but not like changing the theme of, say, a desktop enviorment. It's configuring stuff like bars, window managers and linux terminals to your liking by editing the config files of a wm or bar.

Poyo: Oh wow, that's so cool!
Poyo: You just said ricing is an art, why do you think so?

Overns: I say it's an art because you want to create harmony in every aspect of your system, kinda like reflecting who you are in your own linux build.

Poyo: Did you know I'm learning the "art" of ricing too? It's so entertaining! But time consuming.

Overns: It's very entertaining!!! but i agree, it's quite time consuming, but if you enjoy it and have fun with it i say it's worth it. The time consuming factor is because  you need to make configurations for a LOT of programs, say, your window manager, your composer, your bar, etc. And sometimes you need to see other people's configs just to figure out some things.

Poyo: Would you say you use to inspire yourself on other's configs?

Overns: Yep, i take stuff from other people's configs and try to implement them on my own configs.
Overns: In the case of my old polybar, i took some inspiration from some configs i saw on the internet, sadly i can't remember where i got them...

Poyo: Ooookay! Would you like to share some tips for our fellas about how can we get better at ricing?
