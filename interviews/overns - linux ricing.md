# Linux ricing

Poyo: Welcome to the Poyo Reporter!
Poyo: What's your personal definition of ricing?

Overns: So, ricing is basically the art of customizing linux, but not like changing the theme of, say, a desktop enviorment. It's configuring stuff like bars, window managers and linux terminals to your liking by editing the config files of a wm or bar.

Poyo: Oh wow, that's so cool!
Poyo: You just said ricing is an art, why do you think so?

Overns: I say it's an art because you want to create harmony in every aspect of your system, kinda like reflecting who you are in your own linux build.

Poyo: Did you know I'm learning the "art" of ricing too? It's so entertaining! But time consuming.

Overns: It's very entertaining!!! but i agree, it's quite time consuming, but if you enjoy it and have fun with it i say it's worth it. The time consuming factor is because  you need to make configurations for a LOT of programs, say, your window manager, your composer, your bar, etc. And sometimes you need to see other people's configs just to figure out some things.

Poyo: Would you say you use to inspire yourself on other's configs?

Overns: Yep, i take stuff from other people's configs and try to implement them on my own configs.
Overns: In the case of my old polybar, i took some inspiration from some configs i saw on the internet, sadly i can't remember where i got them...

Poyo: Ooookay! Would you like to share some tips for our fellas about how can we get better at ricing?

Overns: See other people's configs so you can figure some things out. 
Overns: Read the documentation in case you don't understand what certain function does.
Overns: And for the folks out there, i really recommend programs like Pywal, Htop, Mocp, Ranger and Cava so you can add a little "bling bling" to your terminal :D and if you use ZSH install Oh My Zsh. For window managers, go for i3, it's simple to configure but it looks awesome, Openbox if you're into stacking window managers, and for terminal emulators, Alacritty and Kitty are the best for that job.

Poyo: Woah! Thank you very much. I'm sure our fellas will love these tips!
Poyo: So, would you recommend newbies to go ahead and learn ricing straight away or would you have them learn the basics of Linux beforehand?

Overns: I say, learn basic terminal commands and use a good text editor, i use vim in my case, but you can use nano, emacs or vscode. After that, try to use different window managers to see which one you like.

Poyo: Awesome!
Poyo: So that's everything for today! We hope to see you around again. Have a good day!

Overns: Hehe, it's an honor to be interviewed!!
