### Poyo,April

Poyo: Hey there, April! Welcome to the Poyo Reporter.
Poyo: How are you?

April: I'm very well thank you. Excited to be interviewed!

Poyo: Great! So, let's start. I've heard that you're in a band. What's its name?

April: Its called Fudge (I did not choose the name).

Poyo: Thats a cool name. What does Fudge mean?
Poyo: My english aint that good hahaha.

April: Its like a gooey chocolatey sweet.
April: There was not actual idea for choosing the name. It was chosen cause we had about 10 minutes to choose a name before we went on stage to play.

Poyo: How come so?

April: We forgot we needed a name for the band until it was a little too late!

Poyo: Ohhhh I see. Was it a contest?

April: Nope I think it was an open mic at a pub.

Poyo: Awesome. What kind of music do you play?

April: We play rock/blues.

Poyo: OH YEAH!

April: We are a 7 member band with a extremely talented saxophonist and two great singers.

Poyo: That's so cool!

April: I play rhythm guitar usually but I have played bass and lead on some songs.

Poyo: I never understood the difference between the bass and the guitar.

April: Bass is tuned an octave lower and only have 4 strings while the guitar has 6. Bass is for laying down the groove while guitar can flourish overtop or lay down some chords for others to build on.

Poyo: Oh wow, very technical hahaha.

April: As rhythm guitarist my job is usually to play the chords.
April: But on specific songs some fingerpicking has been used.

Poyo: OooOOo. Did anything crazy happen to you while performing?

April: Once the power got cut cause someone in the crowd accidently unplugged everything so the sax player started getting everyone in the crowd to sing some songs. Apart from that nothing else major has happened.

Poyo: Lmao. Have you went in a tour around England?

April: No lol!

Poyo: I wish I could assist to a concert of yours...

April: We do have stuff coming up in September.

Poyo: Hype! :D

April: It would be if everyone did a few more rehearsals lol! 
April: I am getting a little nervous.

Poyo: Why?

April: Not many rehearsals have taken place yet, and we have about a month to go.

Poyo: To go where, xD.

April: Until we have to get up on stage and play music lol.

Poyo: Âªh.
Poyo: So thats why you're worried.

April: Yeah but I'm sure everything will turn out ok in the end.

Poyo: Me too!

April: Cause I don't usually play with the band, most of my guitar practice is classical or jazz on my own.

Poyo: Oh so you're a self taught guitrarist?

April: No, I had a great teacher for a number of years when I was at school.
April: But because I left school I am now self taught I guess.

Poyo: I am also selftaught hahaha. I learnt programming by myself.
Poyo: Did you know I tired to learn how to play the ukelele?

April: Yeah you mentioned it before.
April: I have tried ukulele once before, but its very confusing for a guitar player 'cause the bottom string is the highest in pitch.

Poyo: I actually have forgotten everything. xD

April: Also i really like having 6 strings lol.
April: Although I am intrigued by 5 string guitars cause Jacob Collier uses a 5 string one.

Poyo: Who's Jacob Collier?

April: Jacob Collier is the musical genius of our time.
April: He plays a plethora of instruments and has a ridiculous degree of knowledge and skill in ever single one of them.
April: And hes very good at understanding harmony in a way I don't think anyone else on earth can.

Poyo: Oh cool, isn't that impressive? xD

April: He is very impressive.
April: Im a big fan of Serendipity, All I need and the sun is in your eyes.

Poyo: I'll look 'em out!
Poyo: This question has been around my head since the beginning of the interview: What was the time you got your biggest audience?

April: Probably when we invited all our friends to come watch us play at the pub lol!

Poyo: Lmao.
Poyo: Final question: What's the most important value you've learned while being on the band?

April: Knowing when to shut up and let someone else play!

Poyo: Unexpected lol.

April: Its an important skill.
April: A band is a collaborative thing so you got let everyone have their turn.

Poyo: Makes sense. Wise words, April.
Poyo: Welp, I think thats enough for today, you gotta have some rest. Sip some tea, enjoy Netflix, have fun!
Poyo: This has been everything for today, fellas. See you on the next Poyo Reporter Interview!
