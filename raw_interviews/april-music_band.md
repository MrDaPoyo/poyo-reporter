# April and her band

### Poyo,April

Poyo: Hey there, April! Welcome to the Poyo Reporter.
Poyo: How are you?

April: I'm very well thank you. Excited to be interviewed!

Poyo: Great! So, let's start. I've heard that you're in a band. What's its name?

April: Its called Fudge (I did not choose the name).

Poyo: Thats a cool name. What does Fudge mean?
Poyo: My english aint that good hahaha.

April: Its like a gooey chocolatey sweet.
April: There was not actual idea for choosing the name. It was chosen cause we had about 10 minutes to choose a name before we went on stage to play.

Poyo: How come so?

April: We forgot we needed a name for the band until it was a little too late!

Poyo: Ohhhh I see. Was it a contest?

April: Nope I think it was an open mic at a pub.

Poyo: Awesome. What kind of music do you play?

April: We play rock/blues.

Poyo: OH YEAH!

April: We are a 7 member band with a extremely talented saxophonist and two great singers.

Poyo: That's so cool!

April: I play rhythm guitar usually but I have played bass and lead on some songs.

Poyo: I never understood the difference between the bass and the guitar.

April: Bass is tuned an octave lower and only have 4 strings while the guitar has 6. Bass is for laying down the groove while guitar can flourish overtop or lay down some chords for others to build on.

Poyo: Oh wow, very technical hahaha.

April: As rhythm guitarist my job is usually to play the chords.
April: But on specific songs some fingerpicking has been used.
