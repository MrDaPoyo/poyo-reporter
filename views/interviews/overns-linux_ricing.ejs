<p class="right-text bold">So, ricing is basically the art of customizing linux, but not like changing the theme of, say, a desktop enviorment. It's configuring stuff like bars, window managers and linux terminals to your liking by editing the config files of a wm or bar.</p><p class="right-text bold">I say it's an art because you want to create harmony in every aspect of your system, kinda like reflecting who you are in your own linux build.</p><p class="right-text bold">It's very entertaining!!! but i agree, it's quite time consuming, but if you enjoy it and have fun with it i say it's worth it. The time consuming factor is because  you need to make configurations for a LOT of programs, say, your window manager, your composer, your bar, etc. And sometimes you need to see other people's configs just to figure out some things.</p><p class="right-text bold">Yep, i take stuff from other people's configs and try to implement them on my own configs.</p><p class="right-text bold">In the case of my old polybar, i took some inspiration from some configs i saw on the internet, sadly i can't remember where i got them...</p><p class="right-text bold">See other people's configs so you can figure some things out.</p><p class="right-text bold">Read the documentation in case you don't understand what certain function does.</p><p class="right-text bold">And for the folks out there, i really recommend programs like Pywal, Htop, Mocp, Ranger and Cava so you can add a little "bling bling" to your terminal :D and if you use ZSH install Oh My Zsh. For window managers, go for i3, it's simple to configure but it looks awesome, Openbox if you're into stacking window managers, and for terminal emulators, Alacritty and Kitty are the best for that job.</p><p class="right-text bold">I say, learn basic terminal commands and use a good text editor, i use vim in my case, but you can use nano, emacs or vscode. After that, try to use different window managers to see which one you like.</p><p class="right-text bold">Hehe, it's an honor to be interviewed!!</p>
